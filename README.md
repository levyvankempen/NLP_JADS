Fetching Updates

Before you start working on your project, it's essential to make sure you have the latest changes from the remote repository. Follow these steps to fetch updates:

    Open PyCharm and ensure you have your project opened.

    In the lower-right corner, you'll find the "Version Control" tool window. If you can't see it, go to View > Tool Windows > Version Control to enable it.

    In the "Version Control" tool window, you'll see a "Branches" tab. Click on it to view your branches.

    Click the "Fetch" button to retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository. This ensures your local repository is up to date.

Updating Main Branch

If you are working on the main branch, it's a good practice to update it before creating a new branch for your changes. Follow these steps to update the main branch:

    After fetching updates as mentioned in the previous section, ensure you are on the main branch.

    Right-click on the main branch in the "Branches" tab of the "Version Control" tool window.

    Select "Git" > "Pull" to update your local main branch with the latest changes from the remote main branch.

Creating a New Branch

It's best practice to work on a dedicated branch for your changes to keep your main branch clean. Follow these steps to create a new branch:

    After fetching updates, make sure you are on the main branch as explained in the previous sections.

    Right-click on the main branch in the "Branches" tab of the "Version Control" tool window.

    Select "New Branch" and provide a name for your new branch. This name should be descriptive of the changes you plan to make.

    Click "OK" to create the new branch. You will automatically switch to this new branch.

Committing Changes

After making changes to your code, you need to commit them to your local repository. Follow these steps to commit your changes:

    In the PyCharm editor, open the files you want to commit.

    Make your changes.

    In the "Version Control" tool window, you'll see the files with changes marked. Right-click on them and select "Git" > "Commit..."

    In the commit dialog, provide a meaningful commit message that describes the changes you made.

    Click "Commit" to save your changes to your local repository.

Pushing Changes

Once you've committed your changes locally, you should push them to the remote repository. Follow these steps to push your changes:

    In the "Version Control" tool window, you'll see the branch you are working on. Right-click on it and select "Git" > "Push..."

    Ensure you are pushing to the correct branch in the remote repository.

    Click "Push" to send your committed changes to the remote repository.

Creating a Pull Request

When you want to merge your changes into the main branch, you need to create a pull request. Follow these steps to create a pull request:

    Go to the GitHub repository's web page in your browser.

    Click on the "Pull requests" tab.

    Click the "New Pull Request" button.

    Select your branch as the source branch and main as the target branch.

    Provide a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes in the pull request.

    Click "Create Pull Request" to initiate the review process.

    Your pull request will be reviewed by project collaborators, and once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.

That's it! You now have a comprehensive guide on how to work with this GitHub repository using PyCharm. Follow these steps to collaborate effectively and maintain a clean and up-to-date codebase.
